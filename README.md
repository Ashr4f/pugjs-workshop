# PugJS-Workshop

### Representation:

There's a representation-slide running live on: [Netlify](https://pug-js.netlify.com/)

### Usage (for development purpose only):

Clone the project and run `npx gulp` to run it on [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) (Default port).

### Goal

The goal of this workshop is to make a slider with HTML (Using PugJS of course), CSS (SCSS) and JS.

### Code and preparation

You don't need to code or prepare for the style nor the slider functions (JS), everything is done and ready (Never hesitate to change functions or style but you will lose time :wink:), the only needed thing from you is to transform the HTML template in [example/index.html](https://github.com/Ashr4f/pugjs-workshop/blob/master/example/index.html) into a dynamic PugJS file(s) using PugJS features as much as possible.

**Note**: There's a Gulp.js file with tasks configured already for you, so you don't have to worry about compiling PugJS / SCSS files.

By running `npx gulp` in the repo, Gulp will create a new folder called `dist` with all the needed files and assets.

Don't hesitate if you have any questions.
